This is an exported repository of configuration files and scripts used to
create Joyent's SmartOS packages.  The aim here is to provide users with
everything they may need to replicate those packages, and help them to create
a build environment for developing packages.

While primarily for SmartOS, this repository does also support building on
macOS and Linux.

For instructions on setting up a pkgbuild instance see the 
[pkgsrc wiki](https://github.com/joyent/pkgsrc/wiki/pkgdev:setup)
