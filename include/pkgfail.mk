# Rather than attempting to build packages which are known to fail every time
# and slowing down rebuilds, read in a list of known-broken packages and mark
# them as failed.
#
# To generate the lists for each branch, use something like:
#
#  $ awk -F\| '$2 == "failed" {print $1}' \
#      /shared/bulklog/2014Q1/i386/meta/pbuild | sort > pkgfail/2014Q1-i386
